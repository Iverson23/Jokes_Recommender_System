He couldn't decide   which son he could send to college, since he could only afford to send one.  \n\nThis farmer also had two ducks.  These ducks were retarded.  They were only two ducks on the farm that weren't normal.  He told his sons that whoever could get the most money for the duck would go to college.  \n\nThe sons   went out in attempt to collect as much money as   they could.    The first son was walking down the street when he passed a man working in the yard.  The man asked him if the duck was for sale, for the man loved the taste of ducks.  He offered the son 10 dollars for his duck.  The son decided this was very good, so he took it.  He decided his brother wouldn't be able to get close to his success.\n\nThe second son was walking and passed a whorehouse.  He went in and said that he didn't have any money, but he would give them the duck.  One girl said fine. After they f**ked, she decided that she didn't want the duck anymore.  The son said he would take the duck back if they f**ked again.  She agreed.  After they f**ked the second time, the son left.  \n\nHe was walking home, thinking about what to do with the duck when it broke the leash.  The duck ran out into the street and was hit by a car.  The lady that hit it jumped from her car and started apologizing profusely.  The son insisted it was ok, but the lady said she would pay for the duck.  She was in a hurry, so she gave him 25 dollars and sped off.   \n\nWhen the sons got home, the farmer asked the first son what he got.  He proudly displayed the 10 dollars.  The farmer was impressed.  He asked the second son the same thing.  \n\n\"That's nothing.  I got a f**k for a duck, a duck for a f**k, and 25 dollars for a f**ked up duck.",

        "Joke": "A man buys several sheep, hoping to breed them for wool. After several weeks, he notices that none of the sheep are getting pregnant, and calls a vet for help. The vet tells him that he should try artificial insemination.\n\nThe guy doesn't have the slightest idea what this means but not wanting to display his ignorance, only asks the vet how he will know when the sheep are pregnant. The vet tells him that they will stop standing around and will lie down and wallow in the grass.\n\nThe man hangs up and gives it some thought. He comes to the conclusion that artificial insemination means he has to impregnate the sheep. So, he loads the sheep into his truck, drives them out into the woods, has sex with them all, brings them back, and goes to bed.\n\nThe next morning, he wakes and looks out at the sheep. Seeing that they are all still standing around, he concludes that the first try didn't take, and loads them in the truck again. He drives them out to the woods, bangs each sheep twice for good measure, brings them back, and goes to bed. \n\nThe next morning he wakes to find the sheep still just standing around. One more try, he tells himself, and proceeds to load them up and drive them out to the woods. He spends all day shagging the sheep and upon returning home, falls listlessly into bed. \n\nThe next morning, he cannot even raise himself from the bed to look at the sheep. He asks his wife to look out and tell him if the sheep are lying in the grass. \n\n\"No,\" she says, \"they're all in the truck and one of them is honking the horn.",

The angel smiled to himself as he listened to the two statues giggling, bushes rustling and twigs snapping.\n\nAfter 15 minutes, the two statues emerged from the bushes, satisfied and smiling.\n\nPuzzled, the angel looked at his watch and asked the statues, \"You still have 15 minutes. Would you like to continue?\"\n\nThe male statue looked at the female and asked, \"Do you want to do it again?\"\n\nGiggling, the female statue said, \"Sure, but this time, you hold the pigeon down and I'll crap on its head!",

She applied, but the manager told her that she wouldn't want the job because it was so boring. The blonde begged him and told him she would do anything because she really needed the money. Finally the manager hired her.    \n\nAfter a few hours, the manager noticed that the conveyer belt was backed up. He  went downstairs to find out what was wrong.  He saw that the blonde was sewing two marbles into the crotch of every Elmo.   \n\nThe manager told her, \"I said to give each Elmo two test tickles -- not two testicles!",

The philosopher goes first and asks the Devil a very hard philosophy question -- to which the Devil snaps his fingers, gets a book, and gives the answer. The mathematician tries as well -- but the Devil instantly gets the answer. When it comes to the blonde, she pulls up a chair and drills three holes in it. She then sits down in the chair and farts.\n\n\"Now,\" she says, \"which hole did the fart come out of?\"\n\n\"That's easy,\" says the Devil. \"All of them.\"\n\n\"No, stupid! It came out of my butthole!",

The driver furiously motions for her to pull over.\n\nThe driver gets out and draws a circle and tells her to stand in it. Then he gets out his knife and cuts up her leather seats.

He looks back to see that she's laughing. \n\nHe's really mad now, so he takes his knife and slices her tires. He turns around, and she's laughing so hard that she's about to fall down.

The current rooster was   still doing an okay job, but he was getting on in  years and the farmer figured getting a new rooster   couldn't hurt.  So he buys a new cock from the   local rooster emporium, and turns him loose in the   barnyard.    Well, the old rooster sees the young one strutting   around and he's a little worried about being replaced. He walks up to   the new bird.\n\n\"So you're the new stud in   town?  I bet you really think you're hot stuff   don't you?  Well I'm not ready for the chopping   block yet.  I'll bet I'm still the better bird.    And to prove it, I challenge you to a race around   that hen house over there.  We'll run around it   ten times and whoever finishes first gets to have   all the hens for himself.\" \n   \nWell, the young rooster was a proud sort, and he   definitely thought he was more than a match for   the old guy.  \n\n\"You're on,\" he said, \"and since   I'm so great, I'll even give you a head start of   half a lap.  I'll still win easy!\"   \n\nSo the two roosters go over to the henhouse to   start the race with all the hens gathering to   watch.  The race begins and all the hens start   cheering the old rooster on.  After the first lap,   the old rooster is still maintaining his lead.   \n\nAfter the second lap, the old guy's lead has   slipped a little -- but he's still hanging in there.  Unfortunately, the old rooster's lead continues to   slip each time around, and by the fifth lap he's   just barely in front of the young fella.    By now the farmer has heard the commotion.  He   runs into the house, gets his shotgun and runs   into the barnyard figuring a fox or something is   after his chickens.  When he gets there, he sees   the two roosters running around the henhouse,   with the old rooster still slightly in the lead.    He immediately takes his shotgun, aims, fires, and   blows the young rooster away.    \n\n\"Damn. That's the third gay rooster I've bought this month.",

The following day the teacher asks for the first volunteer to tell their story.\n\nLittle Suzy raises her hand. \"My dad owns a farm and every Sunday we load the chicken eggs on the truck and drive into town to sell them at the market. Well, one Sunday we hit a big bump and all the eggs flew out of the basket and onto the road.\"\nWhen the teacher asked for the moral of the story, Suzy replied, \"Don't keep all your eggs in one basket.\"\nLittle Lucy went next. \"My dad owns a farm too. Every weekend we take the chicken\neggs and put them in the incubator. Last weekend only eight of the 12 eggs hatched.\"\nAgain, the teacher asked for the moral of the story.\nLucy replied, \"Don't count your chickens before they hatch.\"\nNext up was little Johnny. \"My uncle Ted fought in the Vietnam war, and his plane was shot down over enemy territory. He jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a machine gun and a machete. On the way down, he drank the case of beer. Then he landed right in the middle of 100 Vietnamese soldiers. He shot 70 with his machine gun, but then he ran out of bullets! So he pulled out his machete and killed 20 more. Then the blade on his machete broke, so he killed the last ten with his bare hands.\"\nThe teacher looked a little shocked. After clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story.\n\"Well,\" Johnny replied, \"Don't f**k with Uncle Ted when he's been drinking.",

He called up a veterinarian friend of his who told him to bring in his cow. The vet took one look at the cow, stuck a tube up the cow's butt, and blew into the tube until the cow's eyes straightened out. The vet charged the farmer a hundred bucks, and the farmer went home happy. About a week later, the cow's eyes were cross-eyed again, but this time the farmer figured he could probably take care of it himself. So he called his hired hand over, and together they put a tube up the cow's butt. The farmer put his lips to the tube and started to blow. Strangely, nothing happened, so he asked his hired hand to give it a try. The hired hand removed the tube, turned it around, put it in the cow's butt and started to blow.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" asked the farmer, horrified.\n\n\"Well, I wasn't gonna use the side that YOU had put your lips on.",

Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10.\"\n\nJeffery figured he had nothing to lose, so he took his urine sample to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10.00. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed:\n\n\n  \u201cYou have tennis elbow.\n\n  Soak your arm in warm water.\n\n  Avoid heavy lifting.\n\n  It will be better in two weeks.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Late that evening while thinking how\namazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter.  To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He went back to the drug store, located\nthe machine, poured in the sample and deposited $10.00.

        "Joke": "Where do the characters go when I use my backspace or delete them on my PC?  \n\nANSWER: The characters go to different places, depending on whom you ask:\n\nThe Buddhist explanation: If a character has lived rightly, and its karma  is good, then after it has been deleted it will be reincarnated as a different, higher character. Those funny characters above the numbers on  your keyboard will become numbers, numbers will become letters, and lower-case letters will become upper-case. \n\nThe 20th-century bitter cynical nihilist explanation: Who cares? It doesn't really matter if they're on the page, deleted, undeleted, underlined, etc. It's all the same. \n\nThe Mac user's explanation: All the characters written on a PC and then  deleted go to straight to PC hell. If you're using a PC, you can probably see the deleted characters, because you're in PC hell also. \n\nStephen King's explanation: Every time you hit the (Del) key you unleash a tiny monster inside the cursor, who tears the poor, unsuspecting characters to shreds, drinks their blood, then eats them, bones and all.  Hah, hah, hah! \n\nThe Christian Church's approach to characters: The nice characters go to  Heaven, where they are bathed in the light of happiness. The naughty characters are punished for their sins. Naughty characters are those involved in the creation of naughty words, such as \"breast,\" \"sex,\" and contraception.\" \n\nDave Barry's explanation: The deleted characters are shipped to Battle Creek, Michigan, where they're made into Pop-Tart filling; this explains why Pop-Tarts are so flammable, while cheap imitations are not flammable.  I'm not making this up. \n\nIBM's explanation: The characters are not real. They exist only on the screen when they are needed, as concepts, so to delete them is merely to de-conceptualize them. Get a life. \n\nPETA's (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) explanation: You've  been DELETING them??? Can't you hear them SCREAMING??? Why don't you go CLUB some BABY SEALS while wearing a MINK, you pig!!!!",

And searching backup files is a major hassle, so if there is a request for you, God will just say that the tape has been lost.    \n\nQ: Am I unique and special in the universe?  \nA: There are over 10,000 major university and corporate sites running exact duplicates of you in the present release version.    \n\nQ: What is the purpose of the universe?  \nA: God created it because he values elegance and simplicity, but then the users and managers demanded he tack senseless features onto it and now everything is more complicated and expensive than ever.    \n\nQ: If I pray to God, will he listen?  \nA: You can waste his time telling him what to do, or you can just get off his back and let him program.    \n\nQ: What is the one true religion? \n A: All systems have their advantages and disadvantages, so just pick the one that best   suits your needs and don't let anyone put you down.    Q\n\n: How can I protect myself from evil?  \nA: Change your password every month and don't make it a name, a common word, or a date like your birthday.    \n\nQ: Some people claim they hear the voice of God.

He keeps asking the Pontiff   questions about the church and, in particular, the nuns. \"Your Holiness, do you have any really short  nuns?\" Grumpy asks.  \n\n\"No, my son, all of our nuns are at least five feet tall,\" smiles the Pope.  \n\n\"Are you sure?  I mean, you wouldn't have any nuns   that are, say, about my height?  Maybe a little shorter?\"  \n\n\"I'm afraid not.  Why do you ask?\"  \n\n\"No reason,\" replies Grumpy. \"But you're positive?  Nobody in a habit  that's about three feet tall, maybe two-and-a-half feet   tall?\"  \n\n\"I'm sure, my vertically-challenged son,\" says the Pope, trying not show his   curiosity. \n\n\"Okay,\" moans Grumpy.  \n\nSo the Pope listens to the dwarves as they leave the building.  \"What'd he say?  What'd   he say?\"  chant the other six dwarves.  \n\nGrumpy mutters, \"He said they don't have any.\" \n\nAnd   the other six start chanting, \"Grumpy fucked a penguin!  Grumpy fucked a penguin!",

        "Joke": "1. Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play.\n2. Play must be permitted by the owner of the hole.\n3. Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep the balls out.\n4. For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft.  Course owners are permitted to check shaft stiffness before play begins.\n5. Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid damage to the hole.\n6.  The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the course owner is  satisfied that play is completed.  Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to play the course again.\n7. It is considered bad form to begin playing the  hole immediately upon arrival at the course.  The  experienced player will normally take time to admire the entire course with special attention to well-formed bunkers.\n8. Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played, or are currently  playing, to the owner of the course being  played.  Angry course owners have been known to damage players' equipment for this reason.\n9. Players are encouraged to bring proper rain gear for their own protection.\n10. Players should ensure that the match has been properly scheduled, particularly when a new course is being played for the first time.  Previous players have been known to  become irate if they discover someone else playing on what they considered to be a private course.\n11. Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times.  Some players may be embarrassed if they find the course to be temporarily under repair.  Players are advised to be extremely tactful in this situation. More advanced players will find alternative means of play when this is the case.\n12.  The course owner is responsible for manicuring and pruning any bush around the hole to allow for improved viewing of alignment with, and approach to the hole.\n13. Players are advised to obtain the course owner's permission before attempting to play the back nine.\n14. Slow play is encouraged.  However, players should be prepared to proceed at a quicker pace, at least temporarily, at the course owner's request.\n15.  It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to play the same hole several times in one match.",

        "Joke": "From an article in the Wall Street Journal, about the Dutch firm that has been hired to manage the International Arrivals Building at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport:\n\nThe tile under the urinals in the Arrivals Building has that familiar lemony tinge; rubber soles stick to it. Over in Amsterdam, the tile under Schiphol's urinals would pass inspection in an operating room. But nobody notices. What everybody does notice is that each urinal has a fly in it. Look harder, and the fly turns into the black outline of a fly, etched into the porcelain.\n\n\"It improves the aim,\" says Aad Kieboom. \"If a man sees a fly, he aims at it.\" Mr. Kieboom, an economist, directs Schiphol's own building expansion. His staff conducted fly-in-urinal trials and found that etchings reduce spillage by 80%. The Dutch will transfer the technology to New York.\n\n\"We will put flies in the urinals yes,\" Jan Jansen says in a back office at the Arrivals Building. He is the new Dutch general manager, the boss as of noon today. \"It gives a guy something to think about. That's the perfect example of process control.\"\n\nBut a spokesperson for Rudy Guiliani, Mayor of New York, was heard to say, \"What do we need with Dutch flies when we have more than enough roaches to piss on?",

One month later, the following things have occurred....\nOne Italian man killed the other Italian man for the Italian woman.  \nThe two French men and the French woman are living happily together, having loads of sex. \nThe two German men have a strict weekly schedule of when they alternate with the German woman.  \nThe two Greek men are sleeping with each other and the Greek woman is cleaning and cooking for them.  \nThe two English men are waiting for someone to introduce them to the English woman. \nThe Polish men took a long look at the endless ocean and one look at the Polish woman and they started swimming.  \nThe two Japanese men have faxed Tokyo and are waiting for instructions.  \nThe two Australian men beat each other senseless fighting  over the Australian woman, who called them both \u201cbloody wankers\u201d and is checking out all the other men.\nBoth New Zealand men are searching the island for sheep. \nThe Irish began by dividing the island into North and South  and setting up a distillery. They do not remember if sex is in the picture because it gets sort of foggy after the first few liters of coconut whiskey, but they are satisfied in that at least the English are not getting any.    \nThe American woman keeps on bitching about her body being her own, the true nature of feminism, how she can do everything that they can do, about the necessity  of fulfillment, the equal division of household chores, how her last boyfriend respected her opinions and treated her much nicer and how her relationship with her mother is mproving. The two American men have committed suicide.",

From inside they heard a gentleman with a Pakistani accent say, ''You, foreigners! Come in. Come into my humble shop.'' \n\nSo the married couple walked in. The Pakistani man said to them, ''I have some special sandals I think you'd be interested in. They make you wild at sex like a great desert camel.''  \nWell, the wife was really interested in buying the sandals after what the man had claimed, but her husband felt he really didn't need them, being the sex hero he was. The husband asked the man, ''How could sandals make you into a sex freak?''  \n\nThe Pakistani man replied, ''Why don't you try them on and see for yourself?''  \n\nAfter much badgering from his wife, the husband  finally conceded to try them on. As soon as he slipped them onto his feet, he got this wild look in his eyes; something his wife hadn't seen in many years, her husband was full of raw sexual power. \n\nIn a blink of an eye, the husband rushed the Pakistani man, threw him on a table and started tearing at the guy's pants. All the time the Pakistani man was screaming, ''YOU HAVE THEM ON THE WRONG FEET! YOU HAVE THEM ON THE WRONG FEET!''",

They both exit their cars with no injuries, but their vehicles are ruined.\n\nNow, the rivalry between Army and Navy is well known, so needless to say a heated argument followed. Then suddenly the Navy man changed heart and said, \"Hold on, this is dumb. It was an accident. Let's put this rivalry behind us.\"\n\nThe Army man agreed this was a good idea. So the Navy man offered, \"Why don't we celebrate our new friendship over a fifth of vodka? I have a bottle in the truck.\"  \n\nThe Army man thought this was an excellent idea. So the Navy man, being a gentleman, offered  the Army man the first drink, and told the Army man to drink as much as he wanted.  Soon half the bottle was gone and he offered the bottle back to the Navy man who said, \"Thanks, but I'll wait till after the cops get here!",

Feeling pretty good about himself, he went out to the front of the casino to get a cab ride back to the airport. Well who should he see out there, at the end of a long line of cabs, but his old buddy who had refused to give him a ride when he was down on his luck. \nThe businessman thought for a moment about how he could make the guy pay for his lack of charity, and he hit on a plan.       \n The businessman got in the first cab in the line, ''How much for a ride to the airport,'' he asked?\n ''Fifteen bucks,'' came the reply.\n ''And how much for you to give me a blowjob on the way?''\n ''What?! Get the hell out of my cab.''   \n    The businessman got into the back of each cab in the long line and asked the same questions, with the same result.\n When he got to his old friend at the back of the line, he got in and asked, ''How much for a ride to the airport?'' \nThe cabbie replied, ''Fifteen bucks.'' \nThe businessman said, ''OK,'' and off they went.

He went to his baby brother's crib and found that his baby brother had taken a crap in his diaper. So Little Johnny went to his parent's room to get help. When he got to his parent's bedroom, he looked through the keyhole to check if his parents were asleep. Through the keyhole he saw his mom loudly snoring, but his dad wasn't there. So he went to the maid's room. When he looked through the maid's room keyhole, he saw his dad having sex with his maid. Little Johnny was surprised, but then he just realized something and thinks aloud, ''OH!! Now I understand the government! The President is screwing the work force, Congress is fast asleep, nobody cares about the people, and the future is full of s**t!''",

        "Joke": "Remember the book \"Men are from Mars, Women\nare from Venus\"? Well, here's a prime example offered by an English professor at\nSouthern Methodist University:\n\nIn-class Assignment for Wednesday:\n\nToday we will experiment with a new form called the tandem story. The process is simple.\u00a0 Each person will pair off with the person sitting to his other immediate right.\u00a0 One of you will then write the first paragraph of a short story.\u00a0 The partner will read the first paragraph and then add another paragraph to the story.\u00a0 The first person will then add a third paragraph, and so on back and forth.\u00a0 Remember to re-read what has been written each time in order to keep the story coherent. The story is over when both agree a conclusion has been reached. The following was actually turned in by two of my\u00a0 English students, Rebecca [last name deleted] and Gary [last name\ndeleted.] \"\n\nAt first, Laurie couldn't decide which kind of tea she wanted. The chamomile, which used to be her favorite for lazy evenings at home, now reminded her too much of Carl, who once said, in happier times, that he liked chamomile.\u00a0 But she felt she must now, at all costs, keep her mind off Carl.\u00a0 His possessiveness was suffocating, and if she thought about him too much her asthma started acting up again.\u00a0 So chamomile was out of the question.\n\nMeanwhile, Advance Sergeant Carl Harris, leader of the attack squadron now in orbit over Skylon 4, had more important things to think about than the neuroses of an air-headed asthmatic bimbo named Laurie with whom he had spent one sweaty night over a year ago.\u00a0 \"A.S. Harris to Geostation 17,\" he said into his transgalactic communicator.\u00a0 \"Polar orbit established.\u00a0 No sign of resistance so far...\" But before he could sign off, a bluish particle beam flashed out of nowhere and blasted a hole through his ship's cargo bay.\u00a0 The jolt from the direct hit sent him flying out of his seat and across the cockpit.\n\nHe bumped his head and died almost immediately, but not before he felt one last pang of regret for psychically brutalizing the one woman who had ever had feelings for him.\u00a0 Soon afterwards, Earth stopped its pointless hostilities towards the peaceful farmers of Skylon 4. \"Congress Passes Law Permanently Abolishing War and Space Travel,\" Laurie read in her newspaper one morning.\u00a0 The news simultaneously excited\u00a0 her and bored her. She stared out the window, dreaming of her youth\u00a0 -- when the days had passed unhurriedly and carefree with no newspapers to read, no television to distract her from her sense of innocent wonder at all the beautiful things around her.\u00a0 \"Why must one lose one's innocence to become a woman?\" she pondered wistfully.\n\nLittle did she know, but she had less than 10 seconds to live.\u00a0 Thousands of miles above the city, the Au'udrian mothership launched the first of its lithium fusion missiles.\u00a0 The dim-witted wimpy peaceniks who pushed the Unilateral Aerospace Disarmament Treaty through Congress had left Earth a defenseless\u00a0 target for the hostile alien empires who were determined to destroy the human race. Within two hours after the passage of the treaty the Anu'udrian ships were on course for Earth, carrying enough firepower to pulverize the entire planet.\u00a0 With no one to stop them, they swiftly initiated their diabolical plan. The lithium fusion missile entered the atmosphere unimpeded. The President, in his top-secret mobile submarine headquarters on the ocean floor off the coast of Guam, felt the inconceivably massive explosion which vaporized Laurie and 85 million other Americans.\u00a0 The President slammed his fist on the conference table. \"We can't allow this!\u00a0 I'm going to veto that treaty! Let's blow'em out of the sky!\"\n\nThis is absurd.\u00a0 I refuse to continue this mockery of literature. My writing partner is a violent, chauvinistic, semi-literate adolescent.\n\nYeah?\u00a0 Well, you're a self-centered tedious neurotic whose attempts at writing are the literary equivalent of Valium.\n\nAsshole.\n\nBitch.",

In much the same way, the\nhuman brain can operate only as fast as the slowest brain cells through which the\nelectrical signals pass. \n\nRecent emiological studies have shown that while excessive intake of alcohol kills off brain cells, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. \u00a0 Thus, regular consumption of spirits helps eliminate the weaker cells, constantly making the brain a faster and more efficient machine. The result of this in-depth study verifies and validates the causal link between all-weekend parties and job-related performance. It also explains why, after a few short years of completing university\nstudies and then getting married and settling down, most professionals cannot keep up with\nthe performance of the new graduates.\u00a0 Only those few that stick to the strict\nregimen of voracious alcoholic consumption can maintain the intellectual levels that they\nachieved during their university years.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, this is a call to arms.\u00a0 As our\ncountry is losing its technological edge we should not shudder in our homes.\u00a0 But get\nback into the bars\u00a0 and pubs and quaff that pint!\u00a0 Your company and your country\nneeds you to be at your peak, and at your best, and you shouldn't deny yourself the career\nopportunities that you could achieve through excessive alcohol consumption.\u00a0 Take\nlife by the bottle and be all that you can be! And remember a good\u00a0 cold beer will\nkill those bad, useless brain cells that are slowing you\u00a0 down and it will make the\nnecessary room needed to get the good brain cells up front and at the top ready to perform\nat their best.\u00a0 So bottoms up, down\u00a0 the hatch, look out brain it's coming fast!",

The second one goes, ''Well, maybe I'll go talk to them, and maybe they can let us pass them. I'll be back in a sec.''     \n\nSo he trots off, about to go and ask to let them pass. Suddenly, about a hundred feet away from the women,  he stops, turns and runs away from them as fast as he can. When he comes back, he exclaims, ''Jesus! That's my  wife and my girlfriend! They're both here! Golfing together! I'm sorry, man, but I can't say anything to them. I'm  liable to be killed if they saw me. How about you go ask them?''     \n\nSo the other guy concurs, and trots off to ask the women if they can pass and get on with their game. Then he stops suddenly, spins around and runs back  to his buddy in the same manner.     ''What's wrong? What's the matter?'' his friend says.    ''Same damn thing,'' he replies.",

Along the side of the road he sees a sign: \"Apples, $5.00 each.\"  So he pulls over to the side of the road and asks the farmer why his apples are so expensive.  The farmer says, \"Well, these are peanut butter and jelly apples.\"  So the guy buys one.  He says, \"These apples only taste like jelly, where's the peanut butter?\" The farmer says, \"Turn the apple over and take a bit of the other side.\"  Sure enough the other side tasted like peanut butter.   \n\nSo he continues on his way and along the side of the road he sees another sign: \"Apples, $20.00 each.\"  So he gets out and asks the farmer why these apples are so expensive.  \"These are ham and cheese apples,\" the farmer says.  So the guy buys one.  The apple only tasted like ham, so he asked the farmer why and he said, \"Turn the apple over and you will taste the cheese.\"  \n\nThen he is driving down the road again and he sees another sign: \"Apples, $50.00 each.\"  So he asks the farmer, \"What's up with these apples being so expensive?\"  The farmer tells him they are p***y apples.  So the guy buys one.  He takes a bite into the apple and says \"This apple tastes like s**t!\"  And the farmer says, \"Turn it over.",

        "Joke": "ASTROLOGY: tells us about   you and your future simply by your birthday. The Chinese Zodiac uses the year of your birth. Demographics tell us what you like, dislike, whom you vote for, what you buy, and what you watch on TV. Well, the Corporate Zodiac goes a step further: simply by your job title, people will have you all figured out...\n\nMARKETING: You are ambitious yet stupid. You chose a marketing degree to avoid having to study in college, concentrating instead on drinking and socializing, which is pretty much what your job responsibilities are now. Least compatible with Sales.\n\nSALES: Laziest of all signs, often referred to as \"marketing without a degree,\" you are also self-centered and paranoid. Unless someone calls you and begs you to take their money, you like to avoid contact with \"customers\" so you can \"concentrate on the big  picture.\" You seek admiration for your golf game throughout your life.\n\nTECHNOLOGY: Unable to control anything in your personal life, you are\u00a0 instead content to completely control everything that happens at your workplace. Often even YOU don't understand what you are saying, but who the hell can tell?! It is written that the geeks shall inherit the Earth.\n\nENGINEERING: One of only two signs that actually studied in school, it is said that ninety percent of all personal ads are placed by engineers. You can be happy with yourself: your office is typically full of all the latest \"ergodynamic\" gadgets. However, we all know what is really causing your \"carpal tunnel\"...\n\nACCOUNTING: The only other sign that studied in school, you are mostly immune from office politics. You are the most feared person in the organization; combined with your extreme organizational traits, the\u00a0 majority of rumors concerning you say that you are completely insane.\n\nHUMAN RESOURCES: Ironically, given your access to confidential information, you tend to be the biggest gossip within the organization. Possibly the only other person that does less work than marketing, you are unable to return any calls today because you have to get a haircut,\u00a0 have lunch, and mail a letter!\n\nMIDDLE MANAGEMENT/DEPARTMENT MANAGEMENT/\"TEAM LEADS\": Catty, cut-throat, yet completely spineless, you are destined to remain at your current job for the rest of your life.   Unable to make a single decision you tend to measure your worth by the number of meetings  you can schedule for yourself. Best suited to marry other \"Middle Managers,\" as everyone in your social circle is a \"Middle Manager.\"\n\nSENIOR MANAGEMENT: Catty, cut-throat, yet completely spineless, you are destined to remain at your current job for  the rest of your life. Unable to make a single decision you tend to measure your worth by the number of meetings you can schedule for yourself. Best suited to marry other \"Senior Managers,\" as everyone in your social circle is a \"Senior  Manager.\"\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE: Bright, cheery, positive, you are a fifty-cent cab ride from taking your own life. As a child very few of you asked your parents for a little cubicle for your room and a headset so you  could pretend to play \"Customer Service.\" Continually passed over for  promotions, your best bet is to sleep with your boss.",

        "Joke": "An elderly lady phoned her telephone company to report that her telephone failed to ring when her friends called - and that on the few occasions when it did ring, her pet dog always moaned right before the phone rang. The telephone repairman proceeded to the scene, curious to see this psychic dog or senile elderly lady.\n\nHe climbed a nearby telephone pole, hooked in his test set, and dialed the subscriber's house. The phone didn't ring right away, but then the dog moaned loudly and the telephone began to ring.\n\nClimbing down from the pole, the telephone repairman found:\n\n1. The dog was tied to the telephone system's ground wire via a steel chain and collar. \n\n2. The wire connection to the ground rod was loose.\n\n3. The dog was receiving 90 volts of signaling current when the phone number was called.\n\n4. After a couple of such jolts, the dog would start moaning and then urinate on himself and the ground.\n\n5. The wet ground would complete the circuit, thus causing the phone \nto ring.\n\n\nWhich demonstrates that some problems CAN be fixed by pissing and \nmoaning.",

However, it had been a long time since he had tinkered with an engine and he knew that in order to compete with the younger workforce, he would have to go to school. \n\nHe enrolled in a technical institute that specialized in teaching auto mechanics.\nHe aced the course, but the final exam required each student to completely strip and reassemble an engine. It was with some trepidation that he took the test. At completion, he turned the engine over to his instructors for evaluation and awaited his final grade. \nWhen they were handed out, he did a double take at the 150% grade he received.\nRather confused, he asked his instructors how it was possible to have a grade like this. \"It is really quite simple,\" they said. \"We gave you 50% for correctly disassembling the engine, 50% for correctly reassembling it, and an additional 50% for doing it all through the muffler.",

She returns wearing revealing silk lingerie, smiling provocatively.\n\n\"I found some washed up suitcases from the cruise ship a few weeks ago,\" she tells him. \"But now that I've found you, I finally have a reason to wear something sexy again.

Soon, his wife decided to try it out and said the magic words: \"Voodoo D**k my p***y.\" \n\nThe Voodoo D**k flew out of the box and gave her orgasm after orgasm. But soon it became too much, and she couldn't figure out how to make it stop. So she got into her car and began driving to the hospital, swerving so much that she got pulled over by the police. The policeman asked her why she was driving so recklessly and she explained to him that she had a Voodoo D**k inside her that wouldn't leave her alone. \n\nThe policeman looked at her skeptically and said, \"Voodoo D**k, my ass.",

        "Joke": "Whether the cause is a previous night of drinking or a big lunch, the outcome is the same: Farts. \n\nSeventy percent of the time, we can dispense freely. The other 30% of the time, such as at work, we have some tough decisions to make. This document is intended to help you in those decisions. \n  \nHolders - The obvious choice is just plain holding it in. A popular choice among the females and an almost impossible choice for males. I am not in favor of holding, as I believe the medical community has not done enough research about the long-term damage of holding. Really, where does it go if you hold it in? So be forewarned, using this tactic is to be done at your own risk. \n  \nDesk Jockey -  When deciding to release right at your desk, one has many factors to consider: \n\n- Do you have your own office? Feel free to fart at will risk free. After commencing, I highly recommend locking the door and feigning you are not in the office to avoid any unwanted visitors. I also highly recommend against spraying air freshener, as the smell of the freshener is a dead giveaway. Candles are a good alternative solution for the females. \n\n- Are you seated at a cubicle or open desk? If so, one has to consider the proximity of the other workers and the density of workers in the area. If it is just you and one other person in the area, there is nowhere to place the blame. If others are fairly distant to you, the smell will dissipate by the time it reaches the others on all but the most egregious of days. There is always the chance of dispensing at higher decibels than anticipated due to the highly unstable nature of farts. In these most unfortunate situations, you will have to use cover up sounds such as scraping your heal on the floor. I recommend practicing making sounds covering a wide range of tones and pitches in anticipation of such an event. Dropping objects such as staplers, binders and tape may not produce a similar sound, but if done in rapid succession could distract others from the initial event. \n \nMeetings: - Sometimes the urge strikes at the most inopportune time. Meetings and gas really do not mix. Releasing at a meeting is by far the trickiest of all the situations one could find oneself in. Although I am against holding in general, a meeting may be the time for it. It really depends if you have established baseline farts before the meeting. This will give you a sense of the decibel and scent level of what is to be expected. Warning: Do not ever use a meeting as the place to establish a baseline. Of course none of the above applies if you are meeting with vendors. You have free reign to do whatever you like. \n \nAisle Walker: - Releasing while walking around the office is a popular option. By the time the scent disseminates, you should be nowhere near the scene of the incident. The added benefit is that if the release is done at higher decibels than anticipated, you can break out into an all out sprint thereby fleeing the scene before others even look up to notice. \n \nBroom Closet: - One option is to find a broom closet and release inside the closet. The only drawback is explaining why you were in the broom closet if you are caught entering or leaving the closet. I found stashing stationery supplies in the closet provides a nice excuse. People will love you for informing them about the backup stationery supply cabinet. Of course, you then have to find another closet, as your original place will become too risky.\n \nAnd remember, if you're workplace has many open flames, you are on your own.",
